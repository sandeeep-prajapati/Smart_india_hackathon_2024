**Dinesh Kannujiya:**

"Thank you, Om. Once the user interface was designed, my role was to ensure that the overall experience is intuitive and user-friendly, making the interaction with our chatbot as smooth as possible.

I focused on simplifying the user flow so that users can easily upload images, type their queries, and receive responses without any confusion. We have minimized distractions and created a clean design that guides the user step by step, from input to output, ensuring they know exactly what to do at each stage.

Additionally, I worked on optimizing the layout for all devices, so whether someone is using a smartphone, tablet, or desktop, the interface adapts perfectly, offering a consistent and enjoyable experience. The goal was to remove complexity and make it easy for anyone, regardless of technical background, to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.

By focusing on simplicity and clarity, weâ€™ve created an interface that ensures the technology is easy to use and understand for everyone."
