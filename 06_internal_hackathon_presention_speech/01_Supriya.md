**Supriya Pandey:**

"Good morning/afternoon, respected judges, mentors, and fellow participants. We are Team `Code Crafter`, and we are thrilled to introduce our project for the Smart India Hackathon 2024.

Our team consists of six dedicated members:
- **Sandeep Prajapati**, our Team Leader, responsible for designing the NLP system and the image classifier model,
- **Om Pandey**, our talented User Interface designer, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience,
- **Dinesh Kannujiya**, focusing on creating a user-friendly design for seamless interaction,
- **Amisha Singh**, focusing on testing our APIs and modules to ensure everything works perfectly,
- **Kuber Bhagat**, who is responsible for designing and creating our presentation to effectively showcase our solution.

**Problem Statement:**
We are working on a challenge from Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) to develop a solution that integrates natural language processing with computer vision. Our project, the 'Image Recognition Chatbot,' aims to recognize objects in images and generate intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries. 

By using technologies like PyTorch for deep learning, OpenCV for image processing, and NLTK for NLP, our chatbot offers practical applications in industries such as defense, security, and customer service. Weâ€™re excited to present how our solution can tackle real-world problems in an innovative way.


I want to bring Om Pandey on stage for User interface design"
